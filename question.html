					<h5>[Announcement 2023.07.25]</h5>
					<p><b>[Paper Review & Camera Ready Timeline Change]</b> Because of the requirement of the conference organizer,  we need to send all the camera-ready papers by July 31 for publication.  Therefore the review and camera ready submission timeline will be changed as follows:</p>
					<p>- <b>Notification of Acceptance: July 29</b></p>   
					<p>- <b>Camera Ready Deadline:  July 31 </b></p>
					<p>The review process will be expedited to meet the deadline. There is no change in the July 27 paper deadline.  However, if you have already submitted your final version, you may notify me to send them to reviewers earlier.</p>
