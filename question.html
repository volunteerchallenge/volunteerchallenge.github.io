	    			<h5>[Announcement 2023.06.21]</h5>
	    			<p>Hello colleagues, we would like to inform you about some updates regarding the <b>Task 2</b> dataset. The revised version, <span class="label label-default">colab_train.csv</span>, has been modified to adjust the time span of the training dataset to a more realistic setting. 
						The new time range is <span class="label label-default">2020.2-2021.8</span> instead of <span class="label label-default">2020.2-2022.2</span>. Additionally, the corresponding edge list <span class="label label-default">colab_train_edge_list.csv</span> has been updated accordingly. </p>
						<p>Please make sure to utilize the training dataset with the corrected time span when training your model. Furthermore, when submitting your paper, please include your code. </p>
						<p>Please note that these changes may affect the leaderboard. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your cooperation. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
